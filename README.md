# data-explore [![View data-explore on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/106270-data-explore)
A tool that allows data selection from Matlab plots to quickly view details of results. 
This tool creates a series of push buttons on a figure and attaches user specified functions to each.
The tool then tracks user selected datapoints and passes these along when the push button is pressed.
The tool supports multi-point selection, but not region selection, in two and three dimensional charts.
One example usecase is to allow quick assessment of multi-objective machine learning Pareto fronts by visualizing detailed metrics of selected solutions.

Tested on Matlab 2014b, 2016a - 2019b, 2021a
